# Privacy Policy for SkipSter

Effective date: 2025-10-17

SkipSter is a lightweight browser extension that helps skip intros and credits on netflix.com and hotstar.com. This policy explains what data (if any) the extension accesses and how it is handled.

What we collect
- SkipSter does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive user data on external servers.
- The extension uses localStorage in your browser only to save user preferences (for example: enable/disable auto-skip). These settings remain on your device.

Permissions and scope
- The extension only requests the minimum permissions required to run on netflix.com & hotstar.com (to read the page DOM and control playback UI). It does not access other websites or your browsing history.
- No network requests are made to transmit user data to third parties.

Third-party components
- Any third-party libraries included are used only locally inside the extension. They are not used to collect or transmit user data.

User controls
- To remove saved preferences: open the extension options or clear the extension's site data/localStorage in your browser.
- To stop using the extension: uninstall it from your browser's extensions page.

Security and updates
- Prefer minimal permissions and do not store secrets in the extension code.
- This policy may be updated; the effective date above will reflect the latest revision.

Disclaimer
- SkipSter is not affiliated with Netflix, Inc.
- If you discover a security issue or have privacy questions, please open an issue in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/samir-dx/skipster
